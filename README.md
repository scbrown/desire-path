Claude calls `Edit` with `file` instead of `file_path`. The tool rejects it. Claude retries with the right parameter, burning tokens and time. Tomorrow it makes the same mistake. Next week, 23 more times. Across your team, hundreds of wasted retries — all from the same mismatch.

**`dp` captures every failed tool call, surfaces the patterns, and shows you exactly what to fix — or what to build next.**

Think of it like [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) on a campus — worn trails through the grass where people actually walk. You don't fight the path. You pave it.

## 🎬 See It In Action

```bash
# 1. Hook into Claude Code (one-time setup)
$ dp init --source claude-code
✓ Configured Claude Code hooks
  PostToolUseFailure → dp record --source claude-code

# 2. Use Claude Code normally — failures get recorded in the background

# 3. A week later: what's been happening?
$ dp paths --top 5
RANK  PATTERN            COUNT  FIRST_SEEN  LAST_SEEN
1     search_files       47     2026-01-15  2026-02-08
2     Edit:file          23     2026-01-18  2026-02-07
3     execute_command    18     2026-01-20  2026-02-08
4     write_file         12     2026-01-22  2026-02-06
5     list_directory      8     2026-02-01  2026-02-05

# 4. "search_files" keeps failing — what real tool is it closest to?
$ dp suggest search_files
CANDIDATE  SCORE
Grep       0.82
Glob       0.64

# 5. Map the hallucination to the real tool
$ dp alias search_files Grep
✓ Alias: search_files → Grep

# 6. Or better — 47 sessions tried "search_files". That's a feature request.
#    Build an MCP tool called search_files that wraps Grep.
#    dp just told you where to pour the concrete.
```

> **47 failures, one pattern, one fix.** The AI is telling you what the tool *should* have been called. That's a desire path.

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Pattern Detection** — Aggregate failures into ranked paths. See what's breaking most, not just what broke last.

🧠 **Smart Suggestions** — Levenshtein-powered similarity engine finds the real tool name behind every hallucination. CamelCase and underscore-aware.

🔗 **Alias System** — Map `read_file` → `Read` once, see it everywhere. Upsert behavior, instant updates.

🔌 **Plugin Architecture** — Extensible source plugins. Claude Code ships built-in. Write your own in ~50 lines of Go.

📊 **Full Telemetry** — Track *all* tool calls (not just failures) with `--track-all`. Success rates, usage patterns, session timelines.

💾 **Zero-Config Storage** — Embedded SQLite, pure Go, no CGo. Just works. Single file at `~/.dp/desires.db`.

📤 **Export Anything** — JSON, CSV, pipe to `jq`. Your data, your way.

🖥️ **Beautiful Output** — TTY-aware tables with bold headers. `--json` everywhere for scripting.

⚡ **Async & Silent** — Hook execution is async. dp never slows down your AI assistant.

🏗️ **Cross-Platform** — Linux, macOS, Windows. amd64 and arm64. Single binary, zero dependencies.

## 🏗️ How It Works

```mermaid

    A[AI Tool] -->|hook payload| B[Source Plugin]
    B -->|Extract| C[Universal Fields]
    C -->|Ingest| D[SQLite]
    D -->|Query| E[dp list / paths / stats]

    style G fill:#dcedc8,stroke:#558b2f,color:#000
```

**Data flow**: Hook fires → source plugin parses the payload → universal fields extracted → stored in SQLite → query, analyze, and fix with the CLI.
